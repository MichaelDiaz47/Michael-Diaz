A little bit about myself...

<p>I was born and raised in Miami and both my parents are from Nicaragua. I am in the process of receiving my bachelor’s degree in computer science at Florida International University. I just graduated with my Associate in Arts degree from Miami Dade College. Apart from school, I also began working for Bass Pro Shops as a hunting outfitter during the summer break.</p>
<p>I like to do lots of things for fun but some notable ones would include working out, traveling abroad, playing video games, and spending time with my dog, Nena. Nena is a puggle which is a mix between a pug and a beagle. We adopted her from the shelter about a decade ago the day before they were planning on putting her to sleep since no one was selecting her. I’ve always had a strong passion for animals and for the longest time, my plan was to become a veterinarian. When I first chose computer science as my major, I was doing so under the assumption that I'd use it as a flexible degree that could help fund me through vet school. However, after some deep thought and taking everything into account I truly believe computer programming is the career route I'd like to embark on.</p>
<p>In 5-10 years from now, I see myself living in another state or city as the cost of living in South Florida seems to be steadily increasing with no sign of slowing down. I also envision myself with
a master’s degree at this point in whichever field of computer science I decide to hone in on. I would like to be working as a software developer or in a cybersecurity position at a prominent tech company while still learning new skills to make me better at my job.</p>
